# Hi 👋, I'm Nataliia!

I'm just getting into front-end development after coming from an art and design background.
<br/>
I love to experiment with CSS and enjoy doing anything that makes the web more attractive, dynamic, and creative.
<br/>
I am a big fan of Scrum, well-structured things, art-house movies, visual arts, and Thai food.
<br/>
Right now I'm focusing on learning the basic skills and technologies needed for web development in order to start learning more advanced things to help make the web a better place for everyone. 
<br/>
That's what I'm working towards, and I'm excited about the journey ahead.
